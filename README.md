## About

**NibblePy** is a Streamlit-based web app that lets learners discover Python fundamentals through small, well-explained code examples.

The snippets are easy to digest and analyse which helps to understand what's happening under the hood.  

Each snippet is:

- 📦 Categorized for easy discovery  
- 🔍 Searchable by keyword
